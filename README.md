This is my Social Network NoSQL!
Using this in insomnia, I'm able to add users, edit them, delete them, and view them all, or view one by id.
With thoughts, they can be added, edited, deleted, viewed, and you can see the id of the user with the thought.
You can even add one user to another's "friend list", making those two users friends! You can also delete another user from someone's friend list.
I had help from a tutor, asked ChatGPT, and looked over old activities. This was my first project with GitHub co-pilot. It seemed extremely helpful at first, but sometimes it messed me up a bit. Tutor said don't rely on it too much.
In the walkthrough video, this is all demonstrated.
